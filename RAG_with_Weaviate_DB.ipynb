These systems are\\n\\ncharacterized by their ability to perceive, reason, and act with varying levels of complexity, extending human\\n\\ncapabilities in unprecedented ways. While there isn’t a single deﬁnition of agentic AI—what is agreed upon is that\\n\\nagentic AI represents a signiﬁcant leap.\\n\\nOpenAI describes agentic AI systems as those that\\n\\n\"can pursue complex goals with limited direct\\n\\nsupervision.\" Researchers from Stanford, Microsoft,\\n\\nand UCLA characterize AI agents as \"a class of\\n\\ninteractive systems that can perceive visual stimuli,\\n\\nlanguage inputs, and other environmentally-\\n\\ngrounded data, and can produce meaningful actions.\"\\n\\nIBM views AI agents as \"language model-powered\\n\\nentities able to plan and take actions to execute goals\\n\\nover multiple iterations,\" while Google DeepMind\\n\\ndeﬁnes advanced AI assistants as \"artiﬁcial agents\\n\\nwith natural language interfaces, whose function is to\\n\\nplan and execute sequences of actions on behalf of a\\n\\nuser—across one or more domains—in line with the\\n\\nuser\\'s expectations.\"\\n\\nAt Artiﬁciality, we deﬁne agentic AI systems as those\\n\\nthat can perceive, reason, and act with varying\\n\\ncomplexity to extend the human mind beyond our\\n\\ncurrent experience. This deﬁnition emphasizes the\\n\\ntrio of capabilities—perception, reasoning, and action\\n\\n—that we will use to frame various capabilities of AI\\n\\nagents later in this report.\\n\\nThe concept of AI agency AI is not entirely new, with\\n\\nroots tracing back to early systems like IBM\\'s Deep\\n\\nBlue chess-playing system in 1997 and the debut of\\n\\nvirtual assistants like Siri in 2011. However, recent\\n\\nyears have seen a rapid acceleration in the\\n\\ndevelopment and deployment of increasingly\\n\\nsophisticated agentic AI systems. Early experiments\\n\\nlike AutoGPT and BabyAGI caught the AI\\n\\ncommunity’s attention while newer tools and\\n\\nplatforms like Brevian, CrewAI, LangChain, and\\n\\nQurrent provide the ability for individuals and\\n\\norganizations to develop their own AI agents.\\n\\nArtiﬁciality\\n\\nPage 2\\n\\nhello@artiﬁciality.world\\n\\nWe are focused on agentic AI because we believe a) it has the potential to have wide-ranging impacts on how we\\n\\nlive and work, b) these technologies have the potential to both empower and disempower, and c) some level of\\n\\nagency is the future of AI. Giving machines the agency to perceive, reason, and act to accomplish goals might be\\n\\nquite useful with everyday tasks. But there is also the possibility for AI agents to wreak havoc if left unchecked.\\n\\nSince everyone with a computer now has the ability to create agentic AI, there may be little to no ability to control\\n\\nhow and why these agents do what they do.\\n\\nIn this report, we will explore the key components of agentic AI systems, including perception, reasoning, and\\n\\naction. We\\'ll examine how these capabilities can be combined in various ways to create AI agents with different\\n\\nroles and personas, from simple task executors to complex decision support systems. We\\'ll also consider the\\n\\nrealities of deploying agentic AI in real-world contexts, including the shift from designing for human customers\\n\\nto designing for AI agents themselves. Finally, we\\'ll explore the challenges and opportunities of building multi-\\n\\nagent systems and the importance of assembling diverse, multidisciplinary teams to effectively develop and\\n\\nintegrate agentic AI technologies.\\n\\nIf you thought that LLMs changed everything (which they did), agentic AI will change everything even more, even\\n\\nif its full instantiation is many years away.\\n\\nArtiﬁciality\\n\\nPage 3\\n\\nhello@artiﬁciality.world\\n\\nThe Language of Agentic AI: A Caveat\\n\\n“Can machines think? This should begin with deﬁnitions of the meaning of the terms ‘machine’ and “‘think.’”\\n\\n—Alan Turing\\n\\nThe rapid development of agentic AI systems has sparked a need for new metaphors and mental models to\\n\\ncomprehend their complexity. While these AI agents display intricate behaviors and interactions that surpass\\n\\nsimplistic notions of machines, they remain fundamentally distinct from biological life.\\n\\nWhen we describe advanced AI using terms traditionally reserved for living systems, we must recognize that this\\n\\nlinguistic mapping does not imply that AI possesses life or subjective experiences like that of humans. Instead,\\n\\nthis language of life, cognition, and behavior serves as a tool to help conceptualize the increasingly sophisticated\\n\\ncapabilities of AI, which emerge from complex informational dynamics and goal-directed, optimized functions.\\n\\nAs AI agents become more adaptive, interactive, and autonomous, we recognize they occupy a novel space on a\\n\\nmultidimensional continuum of possible complex systems, characterized by varying degrees of design versus\\n\\nemergence and mechanism versus cognition. Across this continuum, agentic AI may functionally mimic\\n\\nproperties of life—such as perception, reasoning, and action—through rational architectures that enable them to\\n\\npursue goals while interacting with complex environments.\\n\\nHowever, we must emphasize that this functional resemblance to living systems does not equate to AI possessing\\n\\nexistential choice, intentionality, phenomenological experience, or metacognition—qualities that characterize\\n\\nbiological cognition and remain qualitatively distinct from the computational processes of artiﬁcial agents.\\n\\nAs we attempt to describe these new AI capabilities, we face the challenge of developing more precise deﬁnitions\\n\\nand conceptual frameworks to reason about the novel design space of agentic systems. In this report, we lay the\\n\\ngroundwork for this task, aiming to maintain a balanced perspective that includes the use of appropriate\\n\\nmetaphors. By doing so, we hope to provide intellectual clarity as we shape a future in which artiﬁcial agents and\\n\\nliving cognitive systems interact in increasingly ﬂuid and synergistic ways.\\n\\nA key challenge is to develop more precise deﬁnitions and conceptual frameworks to reason about this novel\\n\\ndesign space of possible agentic systems, something we attempt to make a start on in this report. Our goal is to\\n\\nmaintain a balanced perspective—including use of appropriate metaphors—which will provide intellectual\\n\\nclarity as we shape a future in which artiﬁcial agents and living cognitive systems interact in increasingly ﬂuid\\n\\nand synergistic ways.\\n\\nArtiﬁciality\\n\\nPage 4\\n\\nhello@artiﬁciality.world\\n\\nUnderstanding Agentic AI\\n\\nAt the core of agentic AI systems are three key components: perception, reasoning, and action. Each of these\\n\\ncapabilities can be present in an AI agent to varying degrees of complexity, allowing for the creation of systems\\n\\nwith diverse skill sets and areas of specialization. By understanding how these components function and interact,\\n\\nwe can better grasp the potential and limitations of agentic AI.\\n\\nPerception\\n\\nUtilizes advanced sensors and and machine learning models to interpret and understand the environment.\\n\\nIncorporates spatial and visual reasoning capabilities to effectively navigate and interact with the physical\\n\\nworld.\\n\\nCombines intuitive pattern recognition with deliberate analysis to process and make sense of complex\\n\\nsensory information.\\n\\nAdapts and reﬁnes perceptual models based on experience and feedback, enabling the agent to handle novel\\n\\nand changing environments.\\n\\nPerception refers to an AI agent\\'s ability to interpret and make sense of its environment. This involves taking in\\n\\ndata from various sensors or input channels and processing it to extract meaningful information. At a basic level,\\n\\nperceptual capabilities might include simple pattern recognition and feature extraction from structured data.\\n\\nHowever, as the complexity of an agent\\'s perception increases, it can begin to handle more diverse, multi-modal\\n\\nsensory inputs and unstructured data.\\n\\nAdvanced perceptual capabilities in AI agents may include sophisticated spatial and visual reasoning, allowing\\n\\nthem to navigate and interact with the physical world in more natural and intuitive ways. These systems can also\\n\\ndemonstrate continuous adaptation and reﬁnement of their perceptual models, learning from experience to\\n\\nbetter handle novel situations and environments.\\n\\nAs the complexity of an AI agent\\'s perception grows, it can give rise to emergent properties and behaviors. The\\n\\nsystem may begin to exhibit a more holistic and contextual understanding of its environment, integrating\\n\\nmultiple sources of information to form a coherent picture of the world around it.\\n\\nReasoning\\n\\nEmploys a combination of logical reasoning, probabilistic inference, and heuristic decision-making\\n\\nto solve problems and make decisions.\\n\\nBalances fast, intuitive processing (System 1) with slower, more deliberate reasoning (System 2)\\n\\nto efficiently handle a range of cognitive tasks.\\n\\nUtilizes spatial and visual representations to support planning, problem-solving, and creative thinking.\\n\\nArtiﬁciality\\n\\nPage 5\\n\\nhello@artiﬁciality.world\\n\\nIncorporates emergent properties arising from the interaction of various reasoning components, enabling the\\n\\nagent to exhibit intelligent behavior beyond the sum of its parts.\\n\\nConsiders the broader context and complex systems in which the agent operates, accounting for the\\n\\ninterdependencies and feedback loops that shape its reasoning processes.\\n\\nReasoning encompasses an AI agent\\'s ability to process information, draw inferences, and make decisions based\\n\\non the data it has gathered through perception. At a basic level, this might involve predominantly heuristic-based\\n\\nreasoning with a limited ability to handle complex or ambiguous problems. Such systems may rely on narrow,\\n\\ndomain-speciﬁc planning and problem-solving strategies with minimal integration of spatial and visual\\n\\nreasoning.\\n\\nAs the complexity of an agent\\'s reasoning increases, however, it can begin to demonstrate a more balanced\\n\\nintegration of intuitive and deliberate reasoning processes. These advanced systems can tackle ill-deﬁned, open-\\n\\nended problems by employing ﬂexible, adaptive problem-solving strategies that span multiple domains. They\\n\\nmay also incorporate seamless integration of spatial and visual reasoning, allowing them to manipulate and draw\\n\\ninsights from perceptual data in more sophisticated ways for more advanced planning and problem-solving..\\n\\nAt the highest levels of complexity, an AI agent\\'s reasoning may begin to consider the broader context and\\n\\ncomplex system dynamics in which it operates. This could involve explicit modeling of the interconnections and\\n\\nfeedback loops that shape the environment, as well as the ability to anticipate and adapt to emergent phenomena.\\n\\nThe result is the emergence of genuinely intelligent decision-making capabilities that can rival or even exceed\\n\\nhuman reasoning in certain domains.\\n\\nAction\\n\\nExecutes actions and interacts with the environment through a combination of pre-deﬁned behaviors,\\n\\nlearned skills, and adaptive control.\\n\\nEmploys spatial and visual reasoning to guide physical actions and manipulations in the world.\\n\\nBalances intuitive, reactive behaviors with deliberate, goal-directed actions to effectively\\n\\nrespond to different situations.\\n\\nLearns and adapts action strategies based on experience and feedback, allowing the agent\\n\\nto improve its performance over time.\\n\\nConsiders the potential emergent consequences of its actions on the broader system\\n\\nand environment in which it operates.\\n\\nAction refers to an AI agent\\'s ability to interact with its environment and effect change based on its perceptual\\n\\ninputs and reasoning processes. At a basic level, this might involve executing simple, pre-deﬁned action routines\\n\\nor motor skills with limited adaptability or learning from experience.\\n\\nAs the complexity of an agent\\'s action capabilities increases, however, it can begin to demonstrate a more diverse\\n\\nand adaptive action repertoire. This might include sophisticated motor skills and behaviors that allow the agent\\n\\nto manipulate objects, navigate environments, and interact with humans in more natural and intuitive ways.\\n\\nArtiﬁciality\\n\\nPage 6\\n\\nhello@artiﬁciality.world\\n\\nAdvanced action capabilities may also involve deliberate, goal-directed control of actions, with the ability to plan\\n\\nand execute complex sequences of behaviors to achieve desired outcomes.\\n\\nCritically, the development of advanced action capabilities in AI agents often involves the integration of spatial\\n\\nand visual reasoning. By leveraging perceptual data to guide physical interactions, these systems can\\n\\ndemonstrate a more embodied and situated form of intelligence that is grounded in the real world.\\n\\nArtiﬁciality\\n\\nPage 7\\n\\nhello@artiﬁciality.world\\n\\nPersonas\\n\\nThe three components of perception, reasoning, and action can be combined in various ways to create AI agents\\n\\nwith different capabilities and specializations. We can think of these combinations as deﬁning different agent\\n\\npersonas, each with its own strengths, limitations, and potential applications.\\n\\nFor example, an AI agent with low complexity in all three components might function as a simple aide or\\n\\nassistant, carrying out basic tasks with minimal autonomy or adaptability. Such a system might be well-suited to\\n\\nhandling routine data entry, scheduling, or customer service inquiries but would likely struggle with more open-\\n\\nended or ambiguous problems.\\n\\nIn contrast, an agent with high complexity reasoning and action capabilities but low complexity perception\\n\\nmight function as a navigator or decision support system. Such an agent could analyze complex datasets,\\n\\ngenerate novel insights, and propose solutions to strategic problems but would rely on human input for situational awareness and contextual understanding.\\n\\nAt the highest end of the complexity spectrum, we might imagine an AI agent with advanced capabilities across\\n\\nall three components—a \"Wayﬁnder\" persona that can navigate uncharted territories, devise innovative solutions\\n\\nto complex problems, and adapt to changing circumstances with a high degree of autonomy. Such a system\\n\\nwould likely excel in domains requiring a combination of perceptual acuity, creative problem-solving, and\\n\\nsituated action, such as leading complex projects or guiding strategic decision-making.\\n\\nBy understanding the interplay of perception, reasoning, and action in agentic AI systems, we can begin to map\\n\\nout the landscape of possible agent personas and skill sets. This, in turn, allows us to more effectively match AI\\n\\ncapabilities to real-world problems and applications, ensuring that we are deploying these powerful tools in ways\\n\\nthat maximize their potential while minimizing risks and unintended consequences.\\n\\nAgentic AI Personas\\n\\nPersona\\n\\nPerception\\n\\nReasoning\\n\\nAction\\n\\nAide\\n\\nLow\\n\\nLow\\n\\nLow\\n\\nTrailblazer\\n\\nLow\\n\\nLow\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nNavigator\\n\\nLow\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nLow\\n\\nPathﬁnder\\n\\nLow\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nLookout\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nLow\\n\\nLow\\n\\nVoyager\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nLow\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nOracle\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nLow\\n\\nWayﬁnder\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nHigh\\n\\nArtiﬁciality\\n\\nPage 8\\n\\nhello@artiﬁciality.world\\n\\nAide\\n\\nPersona\\n\\nPerception\\n\\nReasoning\\n\\nAction\\n\\nAide\\n\\nLow\\n\\nLow\\n\\nLow\\n\\nDescription: Your dependable companion who carries your everyday burdens, guiding you through the basics\\n\\nwith patience and care.\\n\\nHuman Role: The human acts as a direct supervisor, providing step-by-step instructions and monitoring the\\n\\nAI\\'s performance closely.

Your customer service will no\\n\\nlonger solely consider human customers. Your marketing messages will no longer solely focus on human\\n\\nreception. Even your SEO might no longer solely focus on Google Search but on the countless AI agents that each\\n\\nindividual human uses to ﬁnd things on the Agentic Web.\\n\\nAs AI agents become more sophisticated, they may replace human customers in a wide range of interactions. This\\n\\nshift will require companies to fundamentally rethink their approach to customer experience design—shifting\\n\\nfrom customer experience (CX) to agent experience (AX).\\n\\nWhy would we want AI agents to handle these\\n\\ninteractions and experiences for us? First, agents are able to do things we might value: process vast\\n\\namounts of information, make objective decisions,\\n\\nand provide highly personalized experiences based on\\n\\ncomprehensive user data. Second, the future of the\\n\\ninternet (what we call the Agentic Web) will be\\n\\noverwhelmed by AI-generated content that humans\\n\\nwill not be able to process—it will only be readable by\\n\\nmachine. That means we will need AI agents to “read”\\n\\nthe internet for us since the internet will be made by\\n\\nmachines, for machines. Third, agents promise\\n\\nfreedom—freedom from the devices where they work\\n\\nfor us.\\n\\nThe adoption of AI agents is likely to begin with low-\\n\\ninteraction utilities, such as bill payments and simple\\n\\nservice inquiries. These transactions often involve\\n\\nstandardized processes and require minimal personal\\n\\ninput, making them well-suited for automation. As AI\\n\\nagents demonstrate their effectiveness and reliability\\n\\nin handling these tasks, consumers may become\\n\\nmore comfortable entrusting them with more complex\\n\\ninteractions. Imagine an AI agent that you use to purchase products on Amazon. Gone are the days of sifting\\n\\nthrough reviews and wondering if you might have missed something that’s important to you. An AI agent’s\\n\\ncapability to process and analyze vast amounts of data might be increasingly important as the quantity of\\n\\ncomments and reviews increases, written by AI.\\n\\nIt’s important to note here that we are unaware of authentication methods for AI agents that will be required for e-commerce companies, ﬁnancial institutions, and regulators to approve of AI agents conducting transactions.\\n\\nBut that gap is likely just a moment in time. As VeriSign’s authentication services grew out of the need to secure\\n\\nwebsite connections, services to authenticate AI agency will likely be developed too.\\n\\nArtiﬁciality\\n\\nPage 16\\n\\nhello@artiﬁciality.world\\n\\nIt’s not possible to know how far this transition to agentic customers will go and over what time frame. But, no\\n\\nmatter what, this future requires shifting focus from CS to AX. How might you design your company’s external\\n\\nexperience to appeal to AI agents that are acting on behalf of humans?\\n\\nDesigning for AX requires a fundamentally different approach than traditional CX design. Rather than treating\\n\\ninteractions as linear, predictable exchanges of information, AX design must account for the complex, emergent\\n\\ndynamics that arise when your organization’s agents interact with your customer’s agents. This means designing\\n\\ninterfaces and interactions that are not only intuitive and user-friendly for humans, but also for AI agents.\\n\\nDesigning for AI agents also means being prepared for unintended consequences and unexpected behaviors that\\n\\nmay arise from agent-agent interactions. This requires building in safeguards, monitoring mechanisms, and\\n\\ngovernance structures that can detect and respond to emergent risks or harms, while also enabling beneﬁcial\\n\\nforms of emergence and adaptation to occur. And this requires building entirely new safety mechanisms—for\\n\\nboth your organization and your customers.\\n\\nIt’s important to note that these design methods do not exist today. This is an important focus for Artiﬁciality. We\\n\\nworry that the early and easy answers like oversight, override, transparency, explainability, accountability, while\\n\\nessential, will not be sufficient as AI is able to handle more complexity with more agency. And that is happening\\n\\nfaster than anyone thought.\\n\\nAs a start, we offer a framework of seven design considerations, differentiated between a human (CX) and a\\n\\nmachine (AX).\\n\\nCX: Human\\n\\nAX: Machine\\n\\nInformation\\n\\nProcessing\\n\\nLimited attention span. • Susceptible to cognitive biases (e.g., recency bias, conﬁrmation bias), inﬂuenced by emotions and social factors.\\n\\nCan process vast amounts of information quickly, objective and data-driven decision-making.\\n\\nNot inﬂuenced by emotions or social factors.\\n\\nMay choose a product based on a recent ad they saw, even if it\\'s not the best option for their needs.\\n\\nAnalyzes thousands of product reviews and speciﬁcations to determine the best option based on the user\\'s needs and preferences.\\n\\nPersonalization • Appreciates personalized experiences\\n\\nExpects highly personalized\\n\\nbased on past behavior and preferences.\\n\\nexperiences based on comprehensive user data.\\n\\nMay respond positively to subtle cues\\n\\nRequires explicit and transparent\\n\\n\\n\\nand nudges.
